## Getting Started

To implement the CineFluent backend:

1. **Read the Architecture Overview** to understand the system design
2. **Set up the Database** using the schemas documentation
3. **Implement API Endpoints** following the API specifications
4. **Configure Security** using the security guide
5. **Deploy the System** following the deployment guide

Each documentation section provides detailed implementation instructions, code examples, and best practices to ensure a robust, scalable, and secure language learning platform.
